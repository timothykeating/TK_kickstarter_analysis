# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to provide Louise with analysis of previous Kickstarter campaigns so that she may be able to craft her campaign for success.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
When considering all Theater Category launches, warm weather appears to align with the most launches of a successful campaign.  May, June and July had the highest numbers of successful campaigns, while April and August were pretty good, too.  From September to March, there were less successful campaigns, although February was not bad.
