# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to provide Louise with analysis of previous Kickstarter campaigns so that she may be able to craft her campaign for success.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
When considering all Theater Category launches, warm weather appears to align with the most launches of a successful campaign.  May, June and July had the highest numbers of successful campaigns, while April and August were pretty good, too.  From September to March, there were less successful campaigns, although February was not bad.

There were no real challenges during the performance of this analysis, but it should be noted that attention to detail is always key, especially when copying formulae.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
When considering all Play Subcategory launches, it is clear that most Kickstarter campaigns are for small(ish) money.  Over 68% of all Play campaigns were for less than $5000 (720 of the 1047 total projects).  Those campaigns were successful majority of the time - over 75% of campaigns for under $1000 were successful and a similar percentage (72.7%) of campaigns between $1000 and $4999 were successful.
That being said, a majority of campaigns between $35K and $45K were successful, as well.  Once more than $45K was requested, the percentage of successfully funded campaigns went down drastically.

There were no real challenges during the performance of this analysis, but it should be noted that the correct graph should be posted in the correct section of written analysis, lest your analysis be misunderstood.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
